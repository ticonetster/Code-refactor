# Code-refactor

## Description

In order to get familiar with industry standards and guidelines, I copied finished html and css documents.
I made sure functionality, accessibility, order and documentation were taken care of.
Also utilizing github I made sure changes were gradually being logged and shared with the team in a series of commits.
This new code will sove issues with:
  1. functionality, specifically links not associated with a document section.
  2. Accessibility issues:
    a. Proper alternative text on images.
    b. Contrast between background and text.
    c. Defined regions on html.
    d. Proper Title.
  3. Organized CSS structure and comments.

I also learned about web accesability evaluation tools like WAVE and WCAG.

Below is a screenshot of the final product.
